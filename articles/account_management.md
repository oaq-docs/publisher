# Account Management

## About account roles

OAQ is designed to be a multi-tenant platform, which means multiple publishers can use it simultaneously with their own users and branding. This means your organization's data will remain invisible to other publishers.

Note that when we say _publisher_ in this documentation, we mean an [organization](/publisher-workflow/articles/organizations) with an **organization type** of "publisher." The other organization type available is "library."

The OAQ application supports several types of **account roles**, each with different views and permissions. Here they are in order from most to least permissions:

| Account role | Permissions |
|--|--|
|Site admin| Can see and manage all organizations, including creating organizations and inviting users to an organization. Currently limited to Harvard library staff. |
|Organization admin | Can [invite staff to the organization](/publisher-workflow/articles/account_management#inviting-others-to-the-organization), [manage organization users](/publisher-workflow/articles/organizations#managing-organization-users), [edit organization details](/publisher-workflow/articles/organizations#editing-organization-details), [create new questionnaires](/publisher-workflow/articles/questionnaires#creating-a-new-questionnaire), [manage questionnaires](/publisher-workflow/articles/questionnaires#actions-you-can-perform-on-a-questionnaire), [send questionnaires to authors](/publisher-workflow/articles/questionnaires#sending-a-questionnaire-to-an-author), and [manage author responses](/publisher-workflow/articles/questionnaires#managing-author-responses). |
|Organization staff | Can [create new questionnaires](/publisher-workflow/articles/questionnaires#creating-a-new-questionnaire), [manage questionnaires](/publisher-workflow/articles/questionnaires#actions-you-can-perform-on-a-questionnaire), [send questionnaires to authors](/publisher-workflow/articles/questionnaires#sending-a-questionnaire-to-an-author), and [manage author responses](/publisher-workflow/articles/questionnaires#managing-author-responses). |
|Author | Can view, save, and submit questionnaires. |

## Getting started as an organization admin

Before anyone from your organization can do anything in OAQ, a site admin will need to create your organization with some preliminary information that your staff can [edit later](/publisher-workflow/articles/organizations#editing-organization-details).

Your experience as a publisher in OAQ begins when the site admin invites the first member (or members) to the organization as an  **organization admin**.

Each invited organization admin will receive an email that contains an invitation link. If you receive one of these emails and click the link, you will be taken to a page in OAQ where you can confirm your account and create a password. (Note you can always [change your password](/publisher-workflow/articles/account_management#changing-your-password) later.)

## Inviting others to the organization

If you are an organization admin, once you have confirmed your account, you have the ability to invite additional members to the organization and set their organization roles as either **admin** or **staff**. You can also [delete and restore users](/publisher-workflow/articles/organizations#managing-organization-users) as needed.
