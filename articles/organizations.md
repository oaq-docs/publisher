An organization in OAQ may be one of two types: publisher or library. This documentation is intended for a publisher workflow.

An organization must have at least one **organization admin** who may create additional **organization staff**. These staff members can [create and manage questionnaires](questionnaires#creating-a-new-questionnaire), [invite authors to respond to them](questionnaires#sending-a-questionnaire-to-an-author), and [manage author responses](questionnaires#managing-responses).

## Editing organization details

If you are an organization admin, you can customize details about your organization in OAQ.

1. Click **Organization** in the top bar.
2. Click **Edit Organization**.
3. To upload a logo, click **Choose File** and select an image file in PNG or JPG format. This image will appear next to the OAQ logo at the top of the screen and in all your organization's questionnaires.
4. Fill in as many of the rest of the fields as you'd like.
5. To participate in the [ECIP](https://www.loc.gov/publish/cip/about/) program, select the checkbox.
6. Click **Update** to save the details, or click **Cancel** to discard your changes.

## Customizing your organization's questionnaire invitation email

If you are an organization admin, you can customize the email message that will be sent to authors when you [invite them](#questionnaires#sending-a-questionnaire-to-an-author) to questionnaires.

1. Click **Organization** in the top bar.
2. Click **Edit Email Message**.
3. Edit the email text as desired. Note that any words in curly braces are values that will be generated dynamically at the time each email is sent. For example, an author's real email address will be substituted programmatically into the phrase "Hello, {{author_email}}" (without the braces).
4. Click **Update** to save the message, or click **Cancel** to discard your changes.
