An **organization** in OAQ may be one of two types: publisher or library. Note that this documentation is intended for a publisher workflow.

An organization must have at least one **organization admin** who may create additional **organization staff**. These staff can create and manage questionnaires, invite authors to respond to them, and manage author responses.

## Editing organization details

If you are an organization admin, you can add additional details about your organization to OAQ.

1. Click **Organization** in the top bar.
2. Click **Edit Organization**.
3. To upload a logo, click **Choose File** and select an image file (this should be in .png or .jpg format). This will insert an image alongside the OAQ logo at the top of the screen and will be present in all your questionnaires.
4. Fill in as many of the rest of the fields as you'd like.
5. To participate in the [ECIP](https://www.loc.gov/publish/cip/about/) program, select the checkbox.
6. Click **Update** to save your details, or click **Cancel** to discard the changes and go back.

## Managing organization users

To invite a new user:

  1. Click **Invite users**.
  2. Enter the user email addresses and set their organization [roles](/publisher-workflow/articles/account_management#types-of-account-roles) to either **admin** or **staff**.
  3. Click **Invite**.

To edit a user:

  1. Find the user's name in the list.
  2. Under **Actions**, click **Edit**.
  3. Edit the user's email address,  organization role, or both.
  4. Click **Update**.

To delete a user:

  1. Find the user's name in the list.
  2. Under **Actions**, click **Delete**.
