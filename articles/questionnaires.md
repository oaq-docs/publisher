# Questionnaires

## About questionnaires

An **author questionnaire** is a form that a publisher sends to its authors to collect details such as name, publications, biography, contacts, professional interests, PR opportunities, etc. The publisher typically collects this information well in advance of the workâ€™s publication date so that it can be used in the design, promotion, and distribution of the book.

In OAQ, the core objects of a questionnaire are [sections](LINK) comprised of [questions](LINK). An organization [admin](LINK) or [staff](LINK) member assembles these pieces to create each questionnaire.

## Creating a new questionnaire

1. Click **Questionnaires** in the top bar to view a list of all your organization's questionnaires.
2. Click **Create new questionnaire**. Alternatively, click **+ Add a questionnaire** in the top bar.
3. In the popup window, enter a name and description for the questionnaire. This text will be only visible to users within your organization, not authors. You can also [edit](LINK) these details later.
4. Click **Create** to save the new questionnaire, or click **Close** to discard your changes and go back.

If you click **Create**, you will be taken to the [Edit Questionnaire page](link). The questionnaire will be saved to your organization's list, so you can get back to it at any time by clicking **Questionnaires** in the top bar.

## Actions you can perform on a questionnaire

OAQ allows you to perform a number of actions on a saved questionnaire. When you click **Questionnaires** in the top bar, you can view a list of all your organization's questionnaires. The column titled **Actions** lists all the actions you can perform on each one:

|Action|Result|
|--|--|
|_View_|Shows you the questionnaire as the author will see it.|
|_Edit_|Takes you to the [Edit Questionnaire  page](LINK).|
|_Send to author_|Pops up a window where you can [invite authors](LINK) to the questionnaire.|
|_Clone_|Pops up a window where you can enter a name and description in order to [clone](LINK) the questionnaire.|
|_Responses_|Takes you to a page where you can [manage author responses](link) for the questionnaire.|

### Editing a questionnaire

On the **Edit Questionnaire** page, you can assemble the sections and questions that comprise each questionnaire.

You can also click **Name and description** to edit the questionnaire details that appear in the list view.

#### Essential Questions

OAQ requires the collection of some basic author information. This means that when you create a new questionnaire, it will be pre-populated with a section called **Essential questions**. You cannot delete these questions or expand this section, but you can rename the section, create additional sections, and/or move any of the essential questions to other sections.

#### Creating a new section

1. On the **Edit Questionnaire** page, click **Add New Section**.
2. In the popup window, add a name and description for the section. For example, if you want to group biographical questions together, you might enter the name "Biographical information" and add some descriptive text. (Note you can edit the name and description at any time from the main **Edit Questionnaire** page.)
3. Click **Create** to save the section, or click **Close** to discard your changes and go back.

Clicking **Create** will take you back to the **Edit Questionnaire** page where your new section will now appear at the bottom.

#### Adding/removing questions within a section

Once you have created a new section for your questionnaire, you can manage questions within it.

1. On the **Edit Questionnaire** page, find the section you want to manage.
2. Click **Add / Remove questions**.

This will take you to a page where you can perform the following actions.

##### Add an existing question to the section

1. Under **Add Questions**, select a question from the dropdown (or start typing its name in the search box). Note that all [organization-wide questions](link) should appear as options in the dropdown except for [essential questions](link) and questions already in this or another section.
2. Click **Add Question**.
3. Confirm that the question appears under **Questions Currently In this Section**.

##### Create a brand new question and add it to the section

1. Click **Create new question**.
2. In the popup window, fill out the [question components](Question components).
3. Click **Create** to create a new organization-wide question, or click **Cancel** to discard your changes and go back.

Note that if you create a new question this way, it will appear within the section and will _also_ be added to the organization-wide list of questions. You can also do the latter process separately, as described in "[Creating a new question](link)."

##### Remove a question from the section

1. Under **Questions Currently In this Section**, click the trashcan icon next to the name of the question you want to remove.
2. In the popup window, click **Yes** to remove the question, or click **No** to go back.
3. Confirm that the question has disappeared from **Questions Currently In this Section** and is once again available in the dropdown.

Note that this process will only remove the question from the _section_. The question will still exist in the organization-wide list of questions.

When you have finished with this page, click **Done Adding Questions, Take Me Back To Section Editor**.

#### Repositioning a question within a section

1. On the **Edit Questionnaire** page, find the question you want to reposition.
2. To the right of the question, _click and hold_ the **+** icon.
3. Drag the question above or below the other questions in the section as desired.
4. Release the cursor when you are satisfied with the question's position.

#### Moving a question to another section

1. On the **Edit Questionnaire** page, find the question you want to move.
2. To the right of the question, click the link that says **Move to another section**.
3. In the popup window, select the section from the dropdown under **To** that you want to move the question to.
4. Click **Move**.
5. Confirm that the question has moved to the desired section.

#### Repositioning a section

The **Edit Questionnaire** page provides a drag-and-drop interface so you can easily reorder sections within a questionnaire.

1. On the **Edit Questionnaire** page, find the section you want to move.
2. To the right of the **Edit <SECTION> Name and Description** button, _click and hold_ the ![crosshair cursor](/docs/assets/crosshair_cursor.png) icon.
3. Drag the section above or below the other sections on the page as desired.
4. Release the cursor when you are satisfied with the section's position.

#### Removing a section

1. On the **Edit Questionnaire** page, find the section you want to remove.
2. To the left of the **Edit _SECTION_ Name and Description** button, click the ![trashcan](/docs/assets/trashcan_icon.png) icon.
3. In the window that pops up, confirm that you want to permanently remove the section from the questionnaire.

## Sending a questionnaire to an author

Once you are satisfied with a questionnaire, click **I Am Done Making My Questionnaire** at the bottom of the **Edit Questionnaire** page. You can now begin sharing it with authors.

1. Click **Questionnaires** in the top bar to view a list of all your organization's questionnaires.
2. Find the name of the questionnaire you want to share.
2. Under **Actions**, click **Send to author**. (Alternatively, click **View** or **Responses**, then click **Invite Author To Answer The Questionnaire**.)
3. In the popup window, enter the author's email address. To send to multiple authors at once, press `Enter` after typing each email address before typing the next one.
4. Click **Invite** to send the email, or click **Close** to discard your changes and go back.

Clicking **Invite** will send the recipients an email with a link to your questionnaire. Additionally, the questionnaire will be added to the [Responses list](LINK) with a status of _Sent_. (For more information about response status, see "[Managing author responses](LINK).")

## Cloning a questionnaire

If you would like to create a questionnaire that is based on an existing questionnaire rather than creating one from scratch, you can use the _clone_ function.

1. Click **Questionnaires** in the top bar to view a list of all your organization's questionnaires.
2. Find the name of the questionnaire you want to clone.
3. Under **Actions**, click **Clone**.
4. In the popup window, enter a unique name and description for the cloned questionnaire.
5. Click **Clone** to save your cloned questionnaire, or click **Close** to discard your changes and go back.

Clicking **Clone** will save the cloned questionnaire to your organization's list of questionnaires. You can then [edit](LINK) as desired.

## Managing author responses

After you've sent a questionnaire to an author or authors, you can view and manage the status of their responses.

1. Click **Questionnaires** in the top bar to view a list of all your organization's questionnaires.
2. Find the name of the questionnaire for which you want to manage author responses.
3. Under **Actions**, click **Responses**.

The **Answers for questionnaire** page will show a list of each author who has been invited to the questionnaire, along with the date it was last modified and the status of the response. Here's an explanation of the options in the Status dropdown:

| Status | Meaning |
|--|--|
|_Sent_|The questionnaire has been sent to the author, but the author has not saved any progress yet.|
|_In Progress_|The author has accessed the questionnaire and saved some amount of work.|
|_Author Submitted_|The author has gone through each section of the questionnaire and clicked **Submit answers** at the end.|
|_Accepted_|The publisher has marked the questionnaire as **Accepted** using the Status dropdown menu.|

As a publisher, there may be times where you want to work on a questionnaire on behalf of an author. If you click **Submit a new response** at the top of the **Answers for questionnaire** page, you can begin a questionnaire without generating an email to an author. You can then either submit it yourself or share the URL with the author later. Alternatively, you can click **Edit** under **Actions** next to an author's in-progress questionnaire and work on it that way.

### Accepting a response

Once you have determined a response is complete, you can use the Status dropdown menu and mark it as **Accepted**.

A popup window will then prompt you to enter an ISBN. You can enter an ISBN-10 or ISBN-13 and click **Add**, whereupon OAQ will validate the ISBN. Alternatively, you can click **Skip Add ISBN**, or you can click **Close** to discard your changes and go back.

### Exporting responses as CSV

The **Answers for questionnaire** page provides you with the option to **Export All Answers**. If you click this button, a CSV file containing all responses in the list will begin downloading.

You can also download individual responses by clicking **Download CSV** next to any response.

#### Associating responses with ISBNs

It's good practice to associate each response with an ISBN for the work if you have it available. Adding an ISBN will allow you to uniquely identify the book in exported data.

1. On the **Answers for questionnaire** page, find the name of the response you want to add an ISBN to.
2. Under **Actions**, click **Add/Edit ISBN**.
3. On the page that opens, click **Add another ISBN**.
4. Enter an ISBN-10 or ISBN-13. OAQ will validate the ISBN to make sure it is acceptable.
5. Click **Save**.
