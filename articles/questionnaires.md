# Questionnaires

{:toc}

An author questionnaire is a form that a publisher sends to its authors to collect details such as name, publications, biography, contacts, professional interests, PR opportunities, etc.

In OAQ, the core objects of a questionnaire are [sections](#creating-a-new-section) containing [questions](#managing-questions-within-a-section). An [organization admin or staff](account_management#types-of-account-roles) member assembles these pieces to create each questionnaire.

## Creating a new questionnaire

1. Click **Questionnaires** in the top bar to view a list of all your organization's questionnaires.
2. Click **Create a new questionnaire**. Alternatively, click **+ Add a questionnaire** in the top bar.
3. In the popup window, enter a name and description for the questionnaire. This text will be visible only to users within your organization, not authors. You can also edit these details later.
4. Click **Create** to save the new questionnaire, or click **Close** to discard your changes.

If you click **Create**, you will be taken to the [Edit Questionnaire](#editing-a-questionnaire) page. The questionnaire will be saved to your organization's list, so you can get back to it at any time by clicking **Questionnaires** in the top bar.

### Essential Questions section
{:.no_toc}

OAQ requires the collection of some basic author information. This means that when you create a new questionnaire, it will contain a default section called **Essential questions**. You cannot delete these questions, but you can rename the section or distribute the questions to other sections. You can also move questions from other sections into the Essential Questions section, but you cannot create a new question directly in this section.

## Actions you can perform on a questionnaire

OAQ allows you to perform a number of actions on a saved questionnaire. When you click **Questionnaires** in the top bar, you can view a list of all your organization's questionnaires. The column titled **Actions** lists all the actions you can perform on each one:

|Action|Result|
|--|--|
|View|Shows a [view](#viewing-a-questionnaire) of the questionnaire as the author will see it.|
|Edit|Takes you to the [Edit Questionnaire](#editing-a-questionnaire) page.|
|Send to authors|Pops up a window where you can [invite authors](#sending-a-questionnaire-to-an-author) to the questionnaire.|
|Clone|Pops up a window where you can enter a name and description in order to [clone](#cloning-a-questionnaire) the questionnaire.|
|Responses|Takes you to a page where you can [manage author responses](#managing-responses) for the questionnaire.|

The following sections provide more detail on each of these actions.

## Viewing a questionnaire

You can preview how a questionnaire will look to an author.

1. Click **Questionnaires** in the top bar to view a list of all your organization's questionnaires.
2. Find the name of the questionnaire you want to view.
3. Under **Actions**, click **View**.

## Editing a questionnaire

You can customize a questionnaire to meet your organization's needs.

1. Click **Questionnaires** in the top bar to view a list of all your organization's questionnaires.
2. Find the name of the questionnaire you want to edit.
3. Under **Actions**, click **Edit**.

This will take you to a page where you can add sections and questions. You can also click **Name and description** to edit the questionnaire details that are shown in the list view.

The following sections provide more detail on editing functions.

### Creating a new section
{:.no_toc}

1. On the Edit Questionnaire page, click **Add New Section**.
2. In the popup window, add a name and description for the section. For example, if you want to group questions related to biographical details together, you might enter the name "Biographical information" and add some descriptive text. (Note you can edit the name and description at any time from the main Edit Questionnaire page.)
3. Click **Create** to save the section, or click **Close** to discard your changes.

Clicking **Create** will take you back to the Edit Questionnaire page where your new section will appear at the bottom of the page.

### Managing questions within a section
{:.no_toc}

Once you have created a new section in your questionnaire, you can manage questions within it.

1. On the Edit Questionnaire page, find the section you want to manage.
2. Click **Add / Remove questions**.

This will take you to a page where you can perform the following actions.

#### Create a new question and add it to the section
{:.no_toc}

1. Click **Create new question**.
2. In the popup window, fill out the [question components](questions#question-components).
3. Click **Create** to save the question, or click **Cancel** to discard your changes.

Note that if you create a new question this way, it will appear within the section and will _also_ be added to the [organization-wide questions](questions). Alternatively, you can [create an organization-wide question](questions#creating-a-new-question) directly.

#### Add an existing question to the section
{:.no_toc}

This step requires you to have previously added at least one [organization-wide question](questions).

1. Under **Add Questions**, select a question from the dropdown (or start typing its name in the search box). Note that all organization-wide questions will appear as options in the dropdown, but any questions already in the questionnaire will be dimmed; questions that are available to be added will be shown at the top of the results list.
2. Click **Add Question**.
3. Confirm that the question appears under **Questions Currently In this Section**.

#### Remove a question from the section
{:.no_toc}

1. Under **Questions Currently In this Section**, click the trashcan icon next to the name of the question you want to remove.
2. In the popup window, click **Yes** to remove the question, or click **No** to go back.
3. Confirm that the question has disappeared from **Questions Currently In this Section** and is once again available in the dropdown.

Note that this process will only remove the question from the individual _questionnaire_. The question will still exist in the [organization-wide questions](questions).

When you have finished with this page, click **Done Adding Questions, Take Me Back To Section Editor**.

### Moving elements around
{:.no_toc}

The **Edit Questionnaire** page provides a drag-and-drop interface so you can easily reorder questions and sections within a questionnaire.

#### Moving a question within a section
{:.no_toc}

1. To the right of the question, _click and hold_ the **+** icon.
2. Drag the question above or below the other questions in the section as desired.
3. Release the cursor when you are satisfied with the question's position.

#### Moving a question to another section

1. To the right of the question, click the link that says **Move to another section**.
2. In the popup window, select the section from the dropdown under **To** that you want to move the question into.
3. Click **Move**.
4. Confirm that the question has moved to the desired section.

#### Moving an entire section

2. In the popup window, confirm that you want to remove the section from the questionnaire.

## Sending a questionnaire to an author

When you are satisfied with your questionnaire, click **I Am Done Making My Questionnaire** at the bottom of the Edit Questionnaire page. You can now begin sharing it with authors.

1. Click **Questionnaires** in the top bar to view a list of all your organization's questionnaires.
2. Find the name of the questionnaire you want to share.
3. Under **Actions**, click **Send to authors**. (Alternatively, you can click either **View** or **Responses**, then click **Invite authors to answer the questionnaire**.)
4. In the popup window, enter the author's email address. If you're sending to multiple authors at once, press _Enter_ after typing each address before typing the next one.
5. Click **Invite** to send the email, or click **Close** to discard your changes.

Clicking **Invite** will send the recipients your [organization's customized email message](organizations#customizing-your-organization-s-questionnaire-invitation-email) with a link to your questionnaire. Additionally, the questionnaire will be added to the [Responses list](#managing-responses) with a [status](#response-status) of _Sent_.

The publisher staff member who sends the invite will get an email notification when an author has submitted a response.

## Cloning a questionnaire

To create a questionnaire that is based on an existing questionnaire rather than creating one from scratch, you can use the _clone_ function.

1. Click **Questionnaires** in the top bar to view a list of all your organization's questionnaires.
2. Find the name of the questionnaire you want to clone.
3. Under **Actions**, click **Clone**.
4. In the popup window, enter a unique name and description for the cloned questionnaire.
5. Click **Clone** to save your cloned questionnaire, or click **Close** to discard your changes and go back.

Clicking **Clone** will save the new questionnaire to your organization's list. You can then [edit](#editing-a-questionnaire) as desired.

## Managing responses

After you've sent a questionnaire to authors, you can view and manage the status of their responses.

1. Click **Questionnaires** in the top bar to view a list of all your organization's questionnaires.
2. Find the name of the questionnaire that has the author responses you want to manage.
3. Under **Actions**, click **Responses**.

The **Responses for questionnaire** page will show a list of each author who has been invited to the questionnaire, along with the date it was last modified and the [status](#response-status) of the response.

As a publisher, there may be times where you want to work on a questionnaire on behalf of an author. If you click **Start a new response to <name of questionnaire>** at the top of the page, you can begin a questionnaire without generating an email to an author. You can then either submit the questionnaire yourself or share the URL with the author later. You can also work on an author's in-progress questionnaire by clicking **Edit** next to its name in the list.

### Response status
{:.no_toc}

Here’s an explanation of the **Status** dropdown menu options:

| Status | Meaning |
|--|--|
|Sent|The questionnaire has been sent to the author, but the author has not saved any progress yet.|
|In Progress|The author has accessed the questionnaire and saved some amount of work.|
|Author Submitted|The author has gone through each section of the questionnaire and clicked **Submit answers** at the end.|
|Accepted|The publisher has marked the questionnaire as **Accepted** using the Status dropdown menu. This action locks the questionnaire for editing. It also makes the response visible to any libraries [associated](account_management#associating-your-organization-with-libraries) with the publisher.|
|Not Sent|The publisher has created the questionnaire but not yet sent it to authors.|
|Library In Progress|A library associated with the publisher has received the accepted questionnaire and begun processing it.|
|Library Complete|A library associated with the publisher has received the accepted questionnaire and finished processing it.|
|Not processed|A library associated with the publisher has received the accepted questionnaire, but has not begun processing it yet.|

You can see the history of events that have been performed on each response by clicking **Status History** under **Actions**. Clicking this link will pop up a window that shows:

* The email address of the user who changed the status
* The updated status
* The timestamp of the status change

If a response's status has never been changed, the popup window will be blank.

### Accepting a response
{:.no_toc}

Once you have determined a response is complete, you can use the Status dropdown menu to mark it as **Accepted**. This action locks the questionnaire for editing by authors or staff members. It also makes the questionnaire response visible to any libraries [associated](account_management#associating-your-organization-with-libraries) with your organization.

Additionally, a popup window will prompt you to enter an [ISBN](#associating-responses-with-isbns). You can enter an ISBN-10 or ISBN-13 and click **Add**, whereupon OAQ will validate the ISBN. Alternatively, you can click **Skip Add ISBN**, or you can click **Close** to discard your changes.

If you need to undo an **Accepted** status, you can change the status as long as two conditions are met:

1. You haven't ended your browser session by leaving the page, refreshing the page, or logging out of OAQ.

2. A library has not changed the status of the response on their end.

Once either of these events has happened, you will not be able to change the **Accepted** status. Contact your OAQ site admin if you have reason to change an **Accepted** status and are unable to.

### Exporting response data
{:.no_toc}

The **Responses for questionnaire** page provides you with the option to **Export all responses**. If you click this button, a CSV file containing all responses in the list will begin downloading.

You can also download individual responses by clicking the **Download** dropdown next to any response and choosing to download either a **CSV** or **PDF** file.

### Associating responses with ISBNs
{:.no_toc}

It's good practice to associate each response with an ISBN if you have it available. Adding an ISBN will allow you to uniquely identify the work in exported data.

1. On the **Responses for questionnaire** page, find the response you want to add an ISBN to.
2. Under **Actions**, click **Add/Edit ISBN**.
3. On the page that opens, click **Add another ISBN**.
4. Enter an ISBN-10 or ISBN-13. OAQ will validate the ISBN before accepting it.
5. Click **Save**.
