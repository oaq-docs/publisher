Questions are the building blocks of OAQ. You can view a master list of all the questions created within your organization by clicking **Questions** in the top bar.

For information on managing the order and grouping of questions within questionnaires, see "[Editing a questionnaire](LINK)."

## Creating a new organization-wide question

There are two ways to create an organization-wide question without adding it to a specific questionnaire:

* Click **+ Add a question** in the top bar.
* Click **Questions** in the top bar, then click **+ Create new question**.

Both of these buttons will bring you to the **New Question** page where you can fill in the [question components](LINK).

You can [preview](LINK) the question as you go.

When you are finished, click **Create** to save the question, or click **Cancel** to discard your changes and go back.

### Question components
{:.no_toc}

A question is comprised of the following fields:

|Field|Explanation|
|--|--|
|Name|The text of the question that appears in the questionnaire. For example, `Awards`.|
|Help Text|Optional text that appears when an author hovers over the ![question_icon](/docs/assets/question_icon.png) icon next to the question. This text should provide more description or context about what the author should answer. For example, if the name is `Awards`, useful help text might be, `Are there any awards for which you would like us to nominate your book?`|
|Type|Controls the accepted format of the answer. See the table below for more information on the dropdown menu options.|
|Placeholder|Optional text that appears in gray in the answer field, which authors will overwrite. It's helpful for showing an example answer in a particular format. (Note that placeholder text is not available for all question types.)|
|Answer Options|This field will only appear when **Dropdown**, **Multiple Choice**, or **Checkboxes** is selected in the **type field**. In this field, type each answer that you want to appear in your desired dropdown/multiple choice/checkbox list, and press `Enter` before typing the next one.|
|Required for all questionnaires|Check this box to add the question to all new questionnaires your organization creates by default. Old questionnaires won't be allowed to be saved until the question is added.|

Here are the dropdown options for the **type field**:

|Type|Explanation|
|--|--|
|Short Answer|The question will be followed by a single-line field.|
|Long Answer|The question will be followed by a paragraph-sized field|
|Date|The question will be followed by a single-line field. When this field is clicked on, a date picker with calendar view pops up. This helps enforce proper date format.|
|Dropdown|The question will be followed by a dropdown menu that contains all the **Answer Options** you add (see above table.)|
|Multiple Choice|The question will be followed by a multiple choice list of all the **Answer Options** you add (see above table.)|
|Checkboxes||The question will be followed by a checkbox list of all the **Answer Options** you add (see above table.)|

For information on creating a question from within a questionnaire, see "[Create a new question and add it to a section](LINK)."

## Editing a question

Click **Questions** in the top bar, then find the question that you want to edit. Under **Actions**, click **Edit**.

This will bring you to the **Edit Question** page where you can update the [question components](LINK).

You can [preview](LINK) the question as you go.

When you are finished, click **Update** to save the question, or click **Cancel** to discard your changes and go back.

## Previewing a question

On both the **New Question** and **Edit Question** pages, while you are filling in the question components, you can click on the **Preview** tab to see a preview of the question as the author will see it. This is useful when you want to see how the formatting of dropdown menus, multiple choice lists, etc. will look as part of the questionnaire.
