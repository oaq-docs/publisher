Questions are the building blocks of OAQ. You can view a master list of all the questions created within your organization by clicking **Questions** in the top bar.

For information on managing questions within questionnaires, see "[Editing a questionnaire](/publisher-workflow/articles/questionnaires#editing-a-questionnaire)."

## Creating a new question

These steps will create an organization-wide question without adding it to a questionnaire.

1. Click **+ Add a question** in the top bar. (Alternatively, you can click **Questions** in the top bar, then click **+ Create new question**.)
2. On the **New Question** page, fill in the [question components](#question-components).
3. You can [preview](#previewing-a-question) the question as you go.
4. When you are finished, click **Create** to save the question, or click **Cancel** to discard your changes and go back.

### Question components
{:.no_toc}

|Field|Explanation|
|--|--|
|Name|The text of the question that appears in the questionnaire. (For example, `Awards`.)|
|Help Text|Optional text that appears when an author hovers over the question mark icon next to the question. This text should provide more description or context about what the author should answer. (For example, if the name is `Awards`, useful help text might be, `Are there any awards for which you would like us to nominate your book?`)|
|Type|Controls the accepted format of the answer. (See the [table](#type-field-options) below for more on these options.)|
|Placeholder|Optional text that appears in gray in the answer field, which authors will overwrite. It's helpful for showing an example answer in a particular format. (Note that placeholder text is not available for all question types.)|
|Answer Options|This field will only appear when **Dropdown**, **Multiple Choice**, or **Checkboxes** is selected in the [**type** field](#type-field-options). In this field, type each answer that you want to appear in your desired dropdown/multiple choice/checkbox list, and press _Enter_ before typing the next one.|
|Required for all questionnaires|Check this box to add the question to all new questionnaires your organization creates by default. Old questionnaires won't be allowed to be saved until the question is added.|

### Type field options

For information on creating a question from within a questionnaire, see "[Create a new question and add it to a section](/publisher-workflow/articles/questionnaires#create-a-brand-new-question-and-add-it-to-the-section)."

## Editing a question

1. Click **Questions** in the top bar.
2. Find the question you want to edit.
3. Under **Actions**, click **Edit**.
4. On the **Edit Question** page, update the [question components](#question-components).
5. You can [preview](#previewing-a-question) the question as you go.

## Previewing a question

On both the **New Question** and **Edit Question** pages, while you are filling in the question components, you can click on the **Preview** tab to see a preview of the question as the author will see it. This is useful when you want to see how the formatting of dropdown menus, multiple choice lists, etc. will look as part of the questionnaire.
