Welcome to OAQ!

OAQ is a web-based tool that helps publishers create author questionnaires and creates structured data from author responses. 
In future developments, it will also facilitate sharing that data with libraries to allow us to create rich discovery 
metadata earlier in the publication process, and to make authors more discoverable.

You can read more about the project on the [Harvard Library portal](http://library.harvard.edu/oaq).
